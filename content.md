## Manufacturing & Quality Standards

**Philosophy:** "Great manufacturing starts with great quality.". Using advanced machines like TORNOS ensures unmatched precision, consistency, and reliability[cite: 41, 43].

**Raw Materials:**
MGM uses premium-grade titanium to ensure biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and seamless bone integration. Only materials meeting international standards move to production.

- **Improved Sealing:** Tight fit minimizes microgaps, preventing bacterial infiltration and reducing peri-implantitis risk [cite: 201-203].
- **Enhanced Bone Preservation:** Reduces inflammatory response and maintains biological width [cite: 204-206].
- **Better Force Distribution:** Conical design distributes occlusal forces evenly, reducing stress on crestal bone [cite: 207-209].
- **Esthetic Advantages:** Platform switching allows for better soft tissue support [cite: 210-212].
- **Proven Success:** High survival rates in clinical studies[cite: 213, 214].

### 2\. "M Pure" Surface Treatment

A moderately rough surface modification designed to enhance osseointegration.

- **Process:** Sandblasting with biocompatible materials (e.g., titanium oxide).
- **Purity:** **No acid etching** or chemical surface modification. It is free from acid contamination[cite: 219, 247].
- **Roughness:** Ra value 1.42 - 1.74 $\mu m$, ideal for osseointegration.
- **Benefits:**
  - Moderate roughness for strong primary stability[cite: 251, 252].
